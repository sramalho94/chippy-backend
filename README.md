### **_Description_**

Chippy is a full-stack application that helps users locate unique snack products on the road.

Users can post new snack products and where they located them. They can also react and comment on different snack products to share their reviews.

The app was built with Next.js, Tailwind, and HTML on the frontend and Express, PostgreSQL, and Node.js on the backend.
